A lot of home renting management companies still rely on a paper file system in order to keep up with when tenents' lease will expire.  This system will allow them to be able to know when a lease will expire in order to let the current tenents have time to decide if they will continue leasing or if they will move.  Too many times the leasing management company only realizes that the lease needs to be resigned right when the lease is set to expire. This is a problem both for the tenent and for possible future tenents.  If the management company doesn't have enough time to prepare the house to rent out to the next customer then they can possibly lose out on money.  It's also important as things in the market change over the period of the lease, meaning that the next agreement may need to increase the set rental amount.
This matters to me because there have been a couple times when the leasing company did not inform us that a new lease needed to be signed, or that the rent price would increase until the lease needed to be signed.  This gave us no time as renters to be able to adjust our timetable for moving as well.  
I would use a database with the information for each of the properties, the name(s) of the current tenents, lease term, expiration date of lease, and lease price.  Other things to consider would be the information for the owner of the property.

ASD Resource Finder  -- Autism Outreach -- Reaching In to Autism

Currently there is no way for people with Autistic children to know where there are services or what is available in an area without making a hundred phone calls and doing hours upon hours of research. There is no easy way for parents to find these resources, and that makes it difficult for the places offering assistance and the people who need it to connect.  This project would provide a place for both people and services to meet.  This system would be similar to LinkedIn or Facebook where information or updates about the locations can be added.  It will also have a search engine in order to find the services in a specified area.
I have an autistic child and it has been almost a year of research, waiting, and finding available resources in order to help him get the help he needs.  My family is not unique in this dilemma as we have several friends in various parts of the United Sates and overseas that have difficulty finding these resources.  We are also getting ready to move at the beginning of the year, which means we will have to go through this long and painful process again trying to get our son these resources.  It should not be this difficult for a family or for a person to get the help and resources they need.
I will create an online networking site for providers to post thier information and availablity, which would enable those in need to be able to easily find all the information in one spot.  I will do this using ASP.net or another webapp service.

GM Divining Gift

Keeping track of NPC (non player character) and player character information can be difficult as a game is being played.  Sometimes a game master just needs to have an NPC readily available for either the 'heroes' to fight or to have one they can interact with.  This can be one of the most difficult parts about running a game for players.  This internet tool would assist game masters build NPCs 'on the fly.'  It would also help them to keep track of fight order during battles.
I enjoy playing games like Dungeons and Dragons and I have been the game master for a few as well.  It takes a lot of time to design and build NPCs with whom the characters interact. With this tool, the GM can focus on more story elements rather than the NPCs that the characters will only see for a few minutes of the game.
I would use a stored database
