Trocket - 

Intro
In the United States 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with Autism (What is Autism, 2015).  If you include all the people diagnosed so far in the U.S., it totals to over 3.5 million people diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  Currently there are websites that talk about and address issues for those with ASD, and many even give suggestions for therapies.  However, there is not a place on the internet that can easily connect those seeking services for ASD and those who provide those services.

Purpose of the software:

The purpose of this software is to create a place where those who need services and those who provide services for autistic people can get together and see both what services are provided and when they are available.  As people move, one of the most difficult things to do is to find the right kind of services for their needs.  This is so much more true of ASD services as they are not advertised that way, they are advertised as each service which can vary from location to location.

High-level functional requirements (what the program will actually do):

Overall, this program will need to allow two or three types of users: service providers, service seekers, and other organizations.  The main difference between the service seekers, or Trockers, and the other two will be that the Trockers will not be required to input their location or what services they are seeking.  They will, however, be able to seek out the providers information and see what is available in a desired area.  They can “follow” specific clinics or organizations and receive updates from those organizations as they update information.  They will also be able to rate the services they receive and when they were received.  It will also allow Trockers to connect with each other and follow each other (with permission from the one being ‘followed’).

Service providers will be able to post up information about their services, where they are located, contact information and possibly what services are currently available, as well as links to their proper web pages.  Service providers will receive updates when the Trockers follow their profile and can receive updates from them.

Other local support organizations will be able to put up information as well.  Many of these organizations organize special events for fund raisers and awareness, and this project will allow them to put that information out in a single place to garner better turn outs.  These local support organizations end up being the backbone in a lot of places to help people find services, the problem is that a lot of these organizations do not have a strong presence on the internet.

To keep up with all the information, a database with a strong foundation is required.  The information will need to be easily retrievable for those seeking services to query where they can receive those services, while maintaining it’s integrity.

Short discussion on similar software

Currently, the two most prominent designs like the one I am proposing are Facebook and LinkedIn.  LinkedIn is the most like what I want to go with as it has a more professional feel to it than Facebook.  While it would be good to keep things light, it is more important for people to feel like they are dealing with a professional website instead of somewhere they can play Candy Crush.  Like both, there will be a “newsfeed” feature.  Both of these websites are well known for connecting people around the world, which is eventually where I would like this to go.  Both give people a place of belonging and help people cope with their personal and professional issues, get connected with people, and bring people closer together.  This is really what Trocket is about, connecting people with people and people with needed services.

Brief discussion of the project plan

In order to put this project in to motion I will begin by creating a map of how the database should be outlined for all the types of users.  I then layout the design of how I want the user interface to look.  Once the basic layout is set,
